- **Formatted Dates:** Standardized to `DD-MM-YYYY`, derived `Month` and `Quarter`.  
- **Standardized Text:** Corrected inconsistent spacing and case in category/product names.  
- **Handled Outliers:** Removed unrealistic values in `Sales` and `Profit`.  
- **Feature Creation:** Added new column `Profit Margin (%) = (Profit ÷ Sales) × 100`.  
- **Validation:** Verified total sales and profit after cleaning to confirm accuracy.
